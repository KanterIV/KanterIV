### 😎 A little about me:

- 🔥 Front-end developer with a love for crafting sleek UIs and obsessively clean code.
- 📚 Constantly leveling up — tech moves fast, and I’m sprinting to keep pace.
- ☕ My ideal coding session starts with a cup of coffee and a good mood (and sometimes with a couple of bugs that shouldn't be there).
- 🧠 Doing my best not to **drop dead** in these _charming times_ balancing work, life, and self-improvement.
- 🚀 Dreaming of building an app that **doesn't break on the first day of release**. Well, at least I’ll try! 😅
